Environmental degradation has increased over the last several decades. Today, air pollution has been one of the most significant problems nations have to deal with. According to the World Air Quality Report 2019 compiled by IQAir Air Visual, India was the 5th most polluted country in 2019. After COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, on March 25, 2020, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the disease. As a result, the air quality has improved and there has also been a positive effect on the environment. Using data analytics tools, we aim to understand and analyze different trends in the percentage of atmospheric gases based on lockdown restrictions and predict how these trends will manifest soon based on the number of prevalent COVID-19 cases.
